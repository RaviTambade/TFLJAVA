## OOPS (Transflower Way)

👉 *“Listen carefully… programming is not about language first.
Language comes later. Thinking comes first.”*


### The Common Thread 🧵 (C, JavaScript, Node, React)

You all started your journey with **C language**.
Then slowly you moved to **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and now **React JS**.

At first it looks like:

* C is different
* JavaScript is different
* React is something totally new

But internally… **they all share the same soul**.

That soul is 👉 **Object-Oriented Thinking**.


### Real Project Context (Why This Matters)

You saw the **Sambhaji Restaurants** website.
You explored the **Transflower official website**.

The **frontend source code**:

* Built using **Node.js**
* Uses **React components**
* Written using **JSX**

Now JSX looks like magic:

```jsx
HTML + JavaScript
```

But pause here ✋
Behind that React component, the thinking is still:

* data
* behavior
* structure

Exactly what you learned in **C language**.


### Class = Blueprint (Not a Java Thing!)

Many students think:

> “Class means Java or C++”

❌ Wrong.

**Class is a concept**, not a language feature.

In **C language**, we don’t use the keyword `class`,
but we still create **blueprints** using `struct`.

💡 Same thinking, different syntax.


### Why Do We Need a Class (or Struct)?

When an application runs:

* Objects are created
* Objects store data
* Objects perform actions

But before creating an object, we must define:
👉 **What that object looks like**

That definition is called **abstraction**.


### Mentor Example: E-Commerce Application 🛒

Let’s not write code yet.
First, we **think like business people**.

Ask one question:

> “What is the essential behavior of an e-commerce system?”

Answers:

* Customer can **view products**
* Customer can **add product to cart**
* Customer can **place order**
* Customer can **make payment**
* Order gets **confirmed**
* Inventory is **managed**
* Store team **dispatches parcels**

👏 This thinking is called **Object Oriented Analysis (OOA)**

No code.
Only understanding.

### Converting Requirements into Abstraction

Now we say:

> “These behaviors must belong to some entity.”

So we identify entities:

* Product
* Cart
* Order
* Customer
* Inventory

Each entity becomes a **blueprint**.


### C Language Perspective 🧠

In C, we represent a blueprint using `struct`.

Example: **Customer**

```c
struct Customer {
    int customerId;
    char name[50];
    char email[50];
};
```

This is nothing but:
👉 **Class without the class keyword**


### Shopping Cart Example (HAS-A Relationship)

Cart **has items**.

```c
struct Item {
    int itemId;
    float price;
};

struct Cart {
    struct Item items[10];
    int itemCount;
};
```

Mentor voice 😄:

> “See… Cart doesn’t become Item.
> Cart **contains** Item.
> This is HAS-A relationship.”

---

### Behavior Comes Next (Functions)

In C, behavior is written using **functions**.

```c
void addToCart(struct Cart *cart, struct Item item) {
    cart->items[cart->itemCount++] = item;
}
```

So:

* `struct` → **data**
* `function` → **behavior**

Together, they behave like a **class**.

---

### Same Thinking in JavaScript / React

In JavaScript:

```js
class Cart {
  addItem(item) { }
}
```

In C:

```c
struct Cart { };
void addToCart() { }
```

👉 **Same design**
👉 **Same abstraction**
👉 **Different syntax**

### Mentor’s Golden Rule 🪙

> “Don’t fall in love with syntax.
> Fall in love with design.”

### From Analysis → Design → Code

1️⃣ **OOA**
Understand business (customer, order, payment)

2️⃣ **OOD**
Decide:

* Which structs?
* Which functions?
* Which relationships?

3️⃣ **OOP / Programming**
Write code using:

* C
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python

Language is just a **tool**.



### Why Tools Like VS Code, Maven, NPM Exist

VS Code:

* Just an **editor**

Maven / NPM / Pip:

* Maintain **standard structure**
* Manage **dependencies**
* Make code **industry-ready**

Same philosophy everywhere.
---

### Mentor Closing Line 🎓

> “If you understand C properly,
> JavaScript will not scare you.
> React will not confuse you.
> Because **logic never changes**.”



Now listen carefully…

An e-commerce application **does not stop at payment**.

Payment is not the end of the story.
Payment is **just the middle**.


## After Order Confirmation 📦🚚

Once the order is confirmed:

* **Store department** comes into the picture
  👉 They **create parcels**
  👉 They prepare items for **dispatch**

* **Shipping vendor** comes next
  👉 They **pick up the parcel**
  👉 They **ship it from source to destination**

* Finally…
  👉 **Customer receives the product**

💡 This is a **complete business flow**, not a coding flow.



## Mentor Question 🧠

> “Can one single class represent all this?”

❌ No.

Because **different people see the system differently**.


## Different Observers, Different Abstractions 👀

This is where **abstraction becomes powerful**.

We apply abstraction from **three main perspectives**:

### 1️⃣ Customer

### 2️⃣ Shopper / Seller

### 3️⃣ Salesperson (In-house employee)

These are called **observers of the system**.


## Perspective 1: Customer 🧍‍♂️

From **customer’s point of view**, system means:

* View products
* Add product to cart
* Place order
* Cancel order
* Track order
* Receive product

Customer doesn’t care:

* How inventory is managed
* How shipment happens internally

Mentor line:

> “Customer only sees what matters to the customer.”

## Perspective 2: Salesperson 🧑‍💼

Salesperson is an **internal user**.

They care about:

* Approving orders
* Checking inventory
* Monitoring business
* Viewing number of orders
* Handling grievances
* Reviewing customer feedback

They don’t add items to cart.
They don’t make payments.

Different role → different abstraction.

## Perspective 3: Shopper / Seller 🏪

Shopper is the **product owner on the platform**.

They care about:

* Managing inventory
* Adding / updating products
* Seeing product sales
* Monitoring performance

They don’t approve orders.
They don’t ship products.

Again… different abstraction.


## Mentor Insight 💡

> “Same system.
> Different eyes.
> Different responsibilities.”

This is **Object Oriented Analysis (OOA)**.


## What Exactly Is OOA?

OOA means:

* Identify **who uses the system**
* Identify **what each user needs**
* Extract **essential characteristics**

No code.
No language.
Only **thinking**.


## Naming the Process 🧭

We always speak three words together:

### 🔹 OOA – Object Oriented Analysis

👉 *What is required?*

### 🔹 OOD – Object Oriented Design

👉 *How will we design it?*

### 🔹 OOP – Object Oriented Programming

👉 *How do we code it?*


## Common Student Mistake ❌

Most students:

* Jump directly into **OOP**
* Choose one language (Java / Python / JS)
* Start writing code

Mentor warning ⚠️:

> “Without analysis and design, code becomes confusion.”


## Why C Language Is Important Here 🧱

C teaches:

* Structure
* Memory
* Clear separation of data and behavior

Even though C doesn’t have:

* `class`
* `inheritance`

Still…

👉 **OOA and OOD happen before language selection**

C is **perfect for learning design thinking**.


## Mapping Abstraction to C Thinking

Example:

Customer abstraction →

```c
struct Customer {
    int id;
    char name[50];
};
```

Salesperson abstraction →

```c
struct Salesperson {
    int empId;
    char role[30];
};
```

Shopper abstraction →

```c
struct Shopper {
    int sellerId;
    int inventoryCount;
};
```

Same system.
Different structures.
Different responsibilities.


## Mentor Closing for This Section 🎯

> “OOA is asking questions.
> OOD is drawing answers.
> OOP is writing code.”

Once this thinking is clear:

* Language doesn’t matter
* Tool doesn’t matter
* Framework doesn’t matter



## Mentor Voice On 🎓

👉 *“Most students fall in love with a language.
But professionals fall in love with a paradigm.”*


## Language vs Paradigm

Till now, many of you were **language-oriented**:

* C syntax
* Java syntax
* JavaScript syntax

But yesterday we changed the direction.

We said:

> **Object Orientation is not a language feature.
> It is an approach.
> It is a paradigm.
> It is a way of thinking.**

Once your thinking is correct,
**any language will obey you**.

## Thinking Comes First 🧠

So what do we do first?

We don’t write code.
We **gather requirements**.

This process is called:

### 👉 Object Oriented Analysis (OOA)

## OOA: Requirement Gathering Phase 📋

In OOA, requirements are captured in many forms:

* SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
* Product Backlog
* User Stories

Still… no code.

Mentor line:

> “If requirements are unclear, code will be unclear.”

## From Analysis to Design 🏗️

Once requirements are clear:

* Architects come in
* Designers come in

Now they apply:

### 👉 Object Oriented Design (OOD)

OOD means:

* Thinking in terms of **objects**
* Thinking in terms of **classes**
* Defining **relationships**

## Design Creates Artifacts 📐

Design does not create code.
Design creates **artifacts**.

These artifacts are usually **diagrams**.

Designers use:

### UML (Unified Modeling Language)

UML is **not a programming language**.
It is a **visual language**.

## Common UML Diagrams 📊

* Use Case Diagram – *Who can do what*
* Sequence Diagram – *Flow of actions*
* State Diagram – *State changes*
* Class Diagram – *Structure*
* Object Diagram
* Deployment Diagram

Together, these diagrams represent the system.


## Low-Level Design (LLD) 🔍

At this stage we zoom in.

We ask:

> “How is the application internally composed?”

Here we identify:

* **Modules**
* **Models**
* **Responsibilities**

## E-Commerce Modules Example 🛒

From our discussion, we identified:

1️⃣ Product Catalog Module
2️⃣ Shopping Cart Module
3️⃣ Order Processing Module
4️⃣ Payment Module
5️⃣ Shipment Module

Each **module contains multiple objects**.


## Identifying Objects (Entities) 🧩

Now inside modules, we identify **entities**.

### Product Catalog:

* Category
* Product
* Inventory

### Shopping Cart:

* Cart
* Item

### Order Processing:

* Order
* OrderItem
* Invoice
* Bill

### Users:

* Customer
* Shopper
* Salesperson

Mentor reminder:

> “First identify entities.
> Then identify relationships.”


## Relationships in OOD 🔗

In Object Oriented Design, relationships are mainly:

1️⃣ **HAS-A** (Association / Containment)
2️⃣ **IS-A** (Inheritance)


## HAS-A Relationship (Association)

Example:

* Cart **has** Item
* Employee **has** BirthDate

```text
Cart → Item
Employee → BirthDate
```

Objects are **connected**, not hierarchical.

In C thinking:

```c
struct Cart {
    struct Item items[10];
};
```


## IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)

Now comes the important part.

You said three words — remember?

👉 **Customer**
👉 **Shopper**
👉 **Sales Employee**

Mentor pause 🛑

> “Are you listening?”

All three are:
👉 **Users**

So what is the relationship?

Customer **IS A** User
Shopper **IS A** User
Sales Employee **IS A** User

This is **inheritance**.


## Creating the Hierarchy 🌳

Now think one level deeper.

Are users human beings?

Yes.

So we introduce a more generic entity:

### 👉 Person

Only humans can be:

* Users
* Employees
* Customers

No cows.
No machines.
Only people.


## Final Hierarchy (Conceptual)

```text
Person
   ↑
User
  ├── Customer
  ├── Shopper
  └── Employee
        ↑
   SalesEmployee
```

Mentor line:

> “This hierarchy is created during **design**, not coding.”


## Mapping This Thinking to C Language 🧱

C does not support inheritance directly.

But **design still exists**.

We simulate using `struct` composition and discipline.

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
};

struct User {
    struct Person person;
    char username[30];
};

struct Customer {
    struct User user;
};
```

Same hierarchy.
Same thinking.
Different syntax.


## Mentor Closing for This Part 🎯

> “OOA identifies the problem.
> OOD structures the solution.
> OOP implements it in code.”

Language is the **last decision**, not the first.



👉 *“Now observe carefully… hierarchy is not accidental.
Hierarchy is intentional.”*


## Completing the Hierarchy 🧱

We already saw:

* **Person**
* **User**
* **Employee**
* **SalesEmployee**

And in parallel:

* **Customer → User → Person**
* **Shopper → User → Person**

So clearly:

* Customer **IS A** User
* Shopper **IS A** User
* SalesEmployee **IS A** Employee → User → Person

This is a **clean hierarchy**.

And very important point:

> **This hierarchy is finalized during DESIGN, not during coding.**

## Why Design Comes First ✏️

If you don’t design:

* You mix responsibilities
* You duplicate code
* You break abstraction

Design answers:

* Who is responsible for what?
* What data belongs where?
* What behavior belongs where?

## Defining the Blueprints 🧠

Now we ask:

> “How do we define Person, User, Employee, SalesEmployee, Customer, Shopper?”

Answer:
👉 By identifying **essential characteristics**.


## Essential Characteristics – Observer Dependent 👀

### As a **Person**

From e-commerce perspective, we care about:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Contact Number

We don’t care:

* Blood group
* Height
* Weight

Because **observer decides abstraction**.

### As a **User**

User must:

* Log into the system

So essential characteristics:

* Username
* Password
* Email

### As an **Employee**

Employee has:

* Role
* Salary
* HRA
* Tax
* Target

### As a **Sales Employee**

Sales Employee is a **special case**:

* Sales target
* Incentives
* Performance-based rewards

Mentor line:

> “Every sales employee is an employee,
> but not every employee is a sales employee.”

## Blueprint = Class = Abstraction 📘

Once characteristics are identified:

* We group them
* We define a **blueprint**

That blueprint is called:

* C `struct`
* Java `class`
* Python `class`
* JavaScript `class`

Different languages.
Same abstraction.


## C Language Mapping 🧱

```c
struct Person {
    char firstName[30];
    char lastName[30];
    char email[50];
    char phone[15];
};
```

```c
struct User {
    struct Person person;
    char username[30];
    char password[30];
};
```

```c
struct Employee {
    struct User user;
    float basicSalary;
    float hra;
    float tax;
};
```

```c
struct SalesEmployee {
    struct Employee employee;
    int target;
    float incentive;
};
```

This is **inheritance thinking** in C.


## Classes Have Behavior Too ⚙️

A class is not just data.

Classes define **behavior**.

Examples:

* Order → cancelOrder(), processOrder()
* Cart → addItem(), removeItem()
* User → register(), validate()

In C:

* Behavior = **functions**
* Data = **struct**

Together, they behave like a class.

## Modularity & Clustering 🧩

Now comes **organization**.

We don’t put everything in one file.

We **cluster similar classes**.

Business word:
👉 **Module**

Technical words:

* Module
* Package
* Namespace

Depends on language.

## E-Commerce Modules Recap 📦

* Product Module
* Cart Module
* Order Module
* Payment Module
* Shipment Module
* User Module

Each module contains:

* Related structs
* Related functions


## From Design to Code 👨‍💻

Once design is frozen:

* Developers get user stories
* Developers implement design using OOP concepts
* Language is chosen based on:

  * Project requirement
  * Team skill
  * Architect’s decision

Junior devs, senior devs, freshers —
everyone follows **the same design**.

## Developer Environment 🛠️

Different developers may use:

* Eclipse
* VS Code
* Visual Studio
* Jupyter / Anaconda

But at Transflower:
👉 **VS Code is standard**

Uniform tool.
Uniform structure.
Uniform discipline.


## Programming World Begins 🌍

Source code is written in:

* Files
* Folders
* Modules

Each file:

* Contains logic
* Functions
* Data structures

Functions combine to form:

* Entry point
* Business flow

## Mentor Closing for This Section 🎯

> “Design decides quality.
> Language decides syntax.
> Tools decide comfort.”

If design is strong:

* Code is simple
* Maintenance is easy
* Scaling is natural


👉 *“Now we are entering the real industry world… not classroom world.”*



## From Concept to Real Project 📁

So now imagine this…

You open your system.
You go to a workspace.
You see a folder called **TFL Assessment**.

Inside that:

* One folder → **Java**
* Inside Java → **Assessment API**

Immediately you should think:

> “This is not just code.
> This is an application.”

## Industry Does Not Write Single Files ❌

In industry:

* We don’t write **one Java file**
* We don’t write **random code**
* We don’t write **unstructured programs**

We build **applications**.

That’s why we use:
👉 **Build automation tools**

## Java World: Maven 🧰

In Java, the standard tool is:
👉 **Maven**

Maven gives:

* Standard folder structure
* Dependency management
* Build lifecycle

Mentor line:

> “Maven enforces discipline.”

## Standard Java Application Structure 🏗️

A standard Java application must have:

* Startup program
* Multiple class files
* Industry-standard structure

So Maven creates a **skeleton**.

Inside that skeleton:

```text
src
 ├── main
 │    ├── java
 │    └── resources
 └── test
```

## Understanding SRC Folder 🧠

### `src/main/java`

👉 **Actual source code**

* Classes
* Business logic
* Entities
* Services
* Controllers

### `src/main/resources`

👉 Supporting files

* Images
* Config files
* Properties
* Templates

## Object Orientation Inside Folder Structure 📦

Inside `java` folder, we don’t dump everything.

We create **sub-packages**:

* entity
* service
* repository
* controller

Why?
👉 Because **object orientation demands organization**.

## Entities = Classes = Abstraction 📘

From e-commerce example:

* Product.java
* Customer.java
* User.java

From TFL Assessment example:

* Assessment.java

Each file represents:
👉 **One class**
👉 **One abstraction**

## Package Naming = Identity 🏷️

Just like a human being has:

* First name
* Middle name
* Last name
* Family name

Similarly, a class has:
👉 **Package name**

Example:

```java
package com.transflower.tflassessment.entities;
```

Mentor insight:

> “Package name tells where the class belongs.”

## Same Concept Across Languages 🌍

* Java → **package**
* C → **namespace (logical)**
* Node.js → **module**
* Python → **module**

Different keywords.
Same idea:
👉 **Avoid naming conflict**
👉 **Organize code**

## Class Structure (Universal Truth) 🔑

Any class, in any language, has:

* **Data (attributes)**
* **Behavior (methods)**

Java style:

```java
private int score;
public int getScore() { }
```

C style:

```c
struct Assessment {
    int score;
};

int getScore(struct Assessment a) { }
```

Mentor line:

> “Syntax changes. Structure doesn’t.”

---

## Why Tools Like Maven, NPM, PIP Exist 🧠

They exist to:

* Download dependencies
* Manage versions
* Build applications
* Package applications

Examples:

* Java → Maven
* Node.js → NPM
* Python → PIP
* .NET → dotnet CLI

Same purpose.
Different ecosystems.

## Language Alone Is Not Enough ⚠️

To write Java:

* You need **JDK**
* Compiler
* JVM
* Runtime libraries

Java works like this:

```text
.java → compiler → .class (bytecode) → JVM → execution
```

Mentor note:

> “Java runs on JVM, not directly on OS.”


## One Class = One File (Discipline) 📄

Industry rule:
👉 **One class per file**

Not:

* 5 classes in one file
* 2000 lines in one file

Clean separation = maintainability.

## C Language Parallel 🧱

In C:

* One `.h` file → structure
* One `.c` file → behavior

Same philosophy.
Different expression.

## Polyglot Developer Mindset 🌈

Now comes the **Transflower philosophy**.

👉 **Polyglot Developer**
A developer who:

* Does not worship one language
* Understands concepts
* Switches languages comfortably

Like a multilingual human being.


## Mentor Story Example 👑

Our Ex. Prime Minister of India Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao:

* Telugu
* Marathi
* Hindi
* English
* Punjabi

Respect comes from **depth**, not loyalty to one language.

Same with developers.



## Final Mentor Message 🎯

> “Respect comes to a developer
> not because of Java or C or JavaScript,
> but because of **clarity of thinking**.”

So remember:

* Learn languages
* But **master object orientation**
* Become **language independent**
* Become **polyglot**

That is the **ultimate aim of Transflower Learning Framework** 🌱



## Mentor Story Continues 🎓

So now, let’s **zoom into the class** — the heart of object orientation.

Imagine we have an **Assessment class**. What does it contain?

### Data Members: The DNA of a Class 🧬

Every assessment is unique, right?
So we give it **essential characteristics**, like:

* `ID` → unique identifier for assessment
* `testName` → name of the test
* `subject` → subject of the test
* `creationDate` → when it was created
* `scheduleDate` → when it is scheduled

These are **variables**, but in OOP, since they are inside a class, we call them **data members**.


### Access Specifiers: Who Can See What? 👀

Now, not everyone should have access to everything.

We use **access specifiers**:

| Keyword          | Meaning                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `private`        | Only inside the class    |
| `protected`      | Class + children classes |
| `public`         | Anywhere in program      |
| `package` (Java) | Only within package      |

C++ has `public`, `private`, `protected`.
C# adds `internal`.
JavaScript has mostly `public` and now private with `#`.
Python uses naming conventions (`_` or `__`) for privacy.

So, back to our Assessment class:

```java
private int id;          // value type
private String testName;  // reference type
private String subject;   // reference type
private Date creationDate;
private Date scheduleDate;
```

### Data Types: Value vs Reference ⚖️

Now, let’s talk about **data types**, which is very important.

#### 1️⃣ Value Types

* Store actual value **on the stack**
* Examples: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `enum`
* C, C++, Java, C#, all have these

#### 2️⃣ Reference Types

* Store reference **on the stack**
* Actual object created **on the heap**
* Examples: `String`, `Class`, `Interface`, `Array`, `Object`

So in our class:

* `int id` → **stack** (value type)
* `String testName` → **heap** (reference type)

Mentor line:

> “Think of stack as your desk — temporary workspace.
> Heap is your cupboard — stores objects for long-term use.”

### Memory Management in OOP 🧠

When application runs:

* It becomes a **process**
* Each process has its **stack** and **heap**
* **Stack** → stores local variables, function calls
* **Heap** → stores objects, class instances

When the **main function** executes:

* Primary thread handles execution
* Value type variables → live on stack
* Reference type variables → reference on stack, objects on heap

Example in Java:

```java
public class Assessment {
    private int id;              // value type
    private String testName;     // reference type
}
```

* `id = 101` → value stored directly on stack
* `testName = "Math Test"` → reference on stack, object on heap

Mentor note:

> “Heap and stack are like twin kingdoms — one for temporary workers (stack), one for permanent citizens (heap). Every class instance lives on the heap.”


### C Parallel: Stack & Heap 🔄

In C:

```c
struct Assessment {
    int id;           // stack when declared locally
    char* testName;   // pointer, reference to heap
};
```

* `int` → local variable, on stack
* `char*` → pointer stored on stack, actual string created on heap using `malloc()`

In Java, no `malloc()` — JVM handles it with `new` operator.

### Reference Types Across Languages 🌍

* **Java** → class, interface, array → heap
* **C#** → class, interface, delegate → heap
* **Python** → everything is reference type (even integers, technically)
* **JavaScript** → objects, arrays → heap

Mentor insight:

> “Every language may differ in syntax, but the **concept is universal**. Value types → stack, Reference types → heap. Got it? That’s the mental model of a developer.”

### Recap: Assessment Class Blueprint 📘

```java
package com.transflower.tflassessment.entities;

import java.util.Date;

public class Assessment {
    private int id;                // value type
    private String testName;       // reference type
    private String subject;        // reference type
    private Date creationDate;     // reference type
    private Date scheduleDate;     // reference type

    // behaviors like get/set, validate, schedule will come here
}
```

Mentor analogy:

> “Think of class as **blueprint**, data members as **rooms**, access specifiers as **doors**, and data types as **furniture** — some lightweight (stack), some heavy (heap).”


### Mentor Storytelling Style – Continued 📖

So, here we are — our **Assessment class** is taking shape. We already know:

* **Data members** = variables that represent the **state** of the object.
* **Member functions** = methods that represent the **behavior** of the object.

Now let’s explore the **subtleties of memory, instance, and class variables**, along with **encapsulation and getters/setters**, because this is where OOP thinking really starts shining. ✨


### 1️⃣ Stack vs Heap – A Quick Recap 🧠

Remember yesterday we discussed:

* **Stack** → temporary storage for **value types** and **function local variables**. Cleared automatically when function ends.
* **Heap** → permanent storage for **objects** (reference types). Objects survive even after the function that created them ends.

Java, C#, and Python handle heap objects with a **garbage collector**, which automatically cleans memory no longer referenced — so you don’t have to `free()` memory manually like in C.

> Mentor note: “Think of stack as your **desk for active work**, heap as your **warehouse**. Garbage collector is the janitor who throws away unused boxes!” 🧹


### 2️⃣ Instance Variables vs Class Variables 🏷️

* **Instance variables** → belong to a **specific object**.

  * Every object gets its **own copy** of the variable.
  * Example: `id` in Assessment class. Each assessment has its own ID.

```java
Assessment a1 = new Assessment();
a1.id = 101;

Assessment a2 = new Assessment();
a2.id = 102; // separate copy
```

* **Class variables** (static variables) → belong to the **class itself**.

  * Shared by **all objects** of that class.
  * Example: `public static int count;` keeps track of how many Assessment objects are created.

```java
Assessment.count = 5; // all objects see this same variable
```

> Mentor analogy: “Instance variables are like **personal notebooks**, class variables are like **whiteboard in the classroom** — everyone shares it!” 📝


### 3️⃣ Functions / Methods – Logic Inside Classes 🔧

Classes are **data + behavior**.

* **Member functions** belong to the class and operate on its data members.
* They can be **public**, **private**, or **protected**, just like variables.

#### Function structure in Java:

```java
public int getId() {
    return this.id; // 'this' refers to the instance variable
}

public void setId(int id) {
    this.id = id; // local variable 'id' assigned to instance variable
}
```

Key points:

1. **`this` keyword** → distinguishes instance variable from local variable with same name.
2. **Return type** → left of function name. Use `void` if function returns nothing.
3. **Input parameters** → inside parentheses `(int id)`.

> Mentor insight: “Think of getters/setters as **secure gates** to your private data. You control how outsiders access it — that’s **encapsulation**.”


### 4️⃣ Encapsulation – Hiding the Details 🛡️

* **Private variables** → hidden from outside world.
* **Getter/Setter methods** → controlled access to the hidden variables.

```java
private int id;          // hidden data member
public int getId() {     // controlled access
    return this.id;
}
public void setId(int id) { // controlled modification
    this.id = id;
}
```

Why this matters:

* Protects **data integrity**
* Allows **validation logic** inside setter (e.g., no negative IDs)
* Supports **maintainable code**

> Mentor wisdom: “Encapsulation is like having a **vault with a keypad** — you control who can access what, instead of leaving the door wide open.” 🔐

### 5️⃣ Object-Oriented Pillars Recap 🏛️

At this stage, our **Assessment class** demonstrates **all core OOP principles**:

1. **Encapsulation** → private variables + getters/setters
2. **Abstraction** → we only expose necessary behavior, hiding implementation details
3. **Inheritance** → later, we could extend `Assessment` for `QuizAssessment` or `ExamAssessment`
4. **Polymorphism** → later, `getScore()` could behave differently for different assessment types
5. **Modularity** → class as a self-contained module


### 6️⃣ Polyglot Perspective 🌍

Remember, the **concepts remain language-independent**:

| Concept           | Java                      | C#                        | Python               | C++                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Class             | `class Assessment {}`     | `class Assessment {}`     | `class Assessment:`  | `class Assessment {}` |
| Instance variable | `private int id;`         | `private int id;`         | `self.id`            | `int id;`             |
| Class variable    | `public static int count` | `public static int count` | `class var count`    | `static int count;`   |
| Getter/Setter     | `getId()/setId()`         | `getId()/setId()`         | `property` decorator | `getId()/setId()`     |
| Reference type    | `String`                  | `string`                  | `str`                | `std::string`         |
| Value type        | `int, boolean`            | `int, bool`               | `int, bool`          | `int, bool`           |

> Mentor insight: “Once you **master the concept**, switching languages is just syntax — your brain stays in OOP mode!”



So far, we have:

1. **Defined a class** – Assessment
2. **Declared instance & class variables**
3. **Explained memory allocation** – stack & heap
4. **Explored getters/setters** and encapsulation
5. **Mapped concepts across languages**



### 1️⃣ Constructors – The Special Functions 🛠️

So, here’s the key point: **any function whose name exactly matches the class name is a constructor**.

* **Purpose:** Initialize the object right when it is created.
* **No return type:** Constructors never return a value, not even `void`.
* **Two types we typically use:**

1. **Default Constructor** – takes **no parameters**. Sets default values.

   ```java
   public Assessment() {
       this.id = 0;
       this.testName = "Not Assigned";
   }
   ```
2. **Parameterized Constructor** – takes **input parameters** to initialize data members.

   ```java
   public Assessment(int id, String testName) {
       this.id = id;
       this.testName = testName;
   }
   ```

> Mentor analogy: “Think of a constructor like a **birth certificate** for the object. When it comes into the world, it gets its identity — either default or based on what you specify.” 🍼


### 2️⃣ `this` Keyword – The Self Reference 🤝

* `this` is a reference to **the current object**.
* Distinguishes **instance variables** from **local variables**:

```java
public void setId(int id) {
    this.id = id; // instance variable = local variable
}
```

> Mentor note: “If I ask you to describe yourself, you’d say ‘I am Ravi.’ Similarly, objects refer to themselves using `this`. Without `this`, Java cannot tell if you mean local or instance variable.”


### 3️⃣ Method Overloading – Same Name, Different Parameters ⚡

* When you have **multiple functions with the same name but different input parameters**, it’s called **method overloading**.
* Example in your code:

```java
public Assessment() {}                  // default constructor
public Assessment(int id, String name){} // parameterized constructor
```

* **Key idea:** The **method signature** (name + parameters) differentiates them.
* Overloading happens **within the same class**.

> Mentor analogy: “Think of it like calling someone’s name: `Ravi` at home, `Ravi` at office — same name, but the context (parameters) tells you which one is meant.” 🏠🏢


### 4️⃣ Method Overriding – Changing Behavior in Child Classes 🔄

* Overriding is different from overloading.
* **Happens between classes** in a **parent-child hierarchy**.
* You change the behavior of a **function defined in a parent class** in the **child class**.
* Must use **`@Override` annotation in Java** (metadata telling compiler “I am intentionally overriding”).

Example:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Assessment ID: " + this.id + ", Name: " + this.testName;
}
```

> Key points:
>
> * Parent class declares a method (could be `abstract` or `virtual`).
> * Child class **redefines it** for specialized behavior.
> * Relationship is “**is-a**” — e.g., `QuizAssessment is-a Assessment`.

> Mentor analogy: “Imagine your school principal gives a standard speech. But each class teacher overrides it with their own style for students. Same idea — you override behavior while keeping the same ‘contract’.” 🎤


### 5️⃣ `toString()` – A Real-Life Example of Overriding 🖋️

* `toString()` is **defined in Java’s `Object` class** (the root of all classes).
* Overriding it allows your **custom objects** to print meaningful info:

```java
Assessment a1 = new Assessment(101, "Math Test");
System.out.println(a1); 
// Output: Assessment ID: 101, Name: Math Test
```

* Without overriding, `System.out.println(a1)` would print something meaningless like `Assessment@1a2b3c`.

> Mentor insight: “Overriding is how objects speak **human language**, instead of gibberish memory addresses.” 🗣️


### 6️⃣ Bringing It All Together 🎯

So far, in the Assessment class:

| Concept                   | Example in Code                   | Type                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Default Constructor       | `Assessment()`                    | Initialization                    |
| Parameterized Constructor | `Assessment(int id, String name)` | Initialization with values        |
| Getter/Setter             | `getId()/setId()`                 | Encapsulation                     |
| Instance Variable         | `private int id;`                 | Belongs to object                 |
| Class Variable            | `public static int count;`        | Shared across objects             |
| Method Overloading        | Two constructors                  | Same name, different parameters   |
| Method Overriding         | `@Override toString()`            | Change behavior from parent class |

> Mentor takeaway: “Constructors give objects life, getters/setters protect them, overloading gives flexibility, and overriding gives personality.” 🎨


### 1️⃣ Classes and the Object Hierarchy 🏛️

Look at **line 7** in your code:

```java
public class Assessment
```

* No `extends` keyword is explicitly written, right? But here’s the magic:
  **Every class in Java automatically extends the `Object` class** if no other parent is specified.
* Think of the **`Object` class as the mother of all classes**.
* It has some predefined methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `finalize()`, and `clone()`.
* When you override these methods in your class, you’re basically **customizing the behavior inherited from the root parent**.

> Mentor analogy: “Imagine `Object` class as your ancestor who passed down certain traits. You inherit them automatically, but you can change some to suit your own personality.” 👵🧬


### 2️⃣ Concrete vs Abstract Classes 🏗️

* **Concrete Class:** You **can create objects** from it.

  * Example: `Assessment` — we can do `new Assessment()`.
* **Abstract Class:** Contains at least one **abstract method** (method declaration without implementation).

  * Purpose: Define **rules for children**.
  * Example: If `Shape` has `draw()` abstract, every child shape must implement it.

> Mentor note: “It’s like a parent setting rules: ‘You must clean your room.’ The child must follow, but how they clean it is up to them.” 🏠


### 3️⃣ Overriding vs Overloading 🔄⚡

* **Method Overloading:** Same name, different parameters **within the same class**.

  * Example: Two constructors in `Assessment`.
  * **Static/compile-time polymorphism / early binding**.
* **Method Overriding:** Same name, same parameters, but in **child class**, changing behavior of parent class method.

  * Example: Overriding `toString()`.
  * **Dynamic/runtime polymorphism / late binding**.

> Mentor analogy:
>
> * Overloading → “I can write my name in different styles depending on situation.” ✍️
> * Overriding → “I change the family recipe to my own style, while keeping it recognizable.” 🍲


### 4️⃣ Polymorphism – The Many Forms ✨

**Polymorphism = Many forms**.

* **Static Polymorphism:** Compile-time decisions (method overloading).
* **Dynamic Polymorphism:** Runtime decisions (method overriding).

> Mentor note: “Polymorphism allows a single object or method to **behave differently depending on context**. That’s powerful!” 💪

### 5️⃣ Inheritance – Reusing Code 👪

* **Purpose:** Reuse code, maintain hierarchy, enable overriding.
* **Relationship:** “is-a”

  * Example: `QuizAssessment is-a Assessment`.
* **Super / Subclass terminology:**

  * Superclass = parent/base class
  * Subclass = child/derived class

> Mentor analogy: “Inheritance is genetic. You don’t need to re-learn how to breathe because you inherit it!” 🌱

### 6️⃣ Containment, Aggregation, Composition – The “Has-A” Relationship 🏠

* **Containment:** One class contains another as a member.

  * Example: `Person` has a `BirthDate`.
* **Aggregation:** Weak “has-a” relationship. Object exists independently.
* **Composition:** Strong “has-a” relationship. Object depends on parent lifecycle.

> Mentor analogy:
>
> * Aggregation → “Car has an engine, engine can exist separately.” 🚗
> * Composition → “Car has a steering wheel, wheel cannot exist independently.” 🛞

### 7️⃣ Encapsulation & Abstraction 🛡️

* **Encapsulation:** Hiding data, exposing only through getters/setters.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation, showing only essential behavior.

> Mentor note: “Think of encapsulation as a pillbox — the medicine inside is protected. Abstraction is the label telling you how to take it, without showing the chemistry inside.” 💊


### 8️⃣ The Developer Mindset 🧠

You emphasized this brilliantly:

* **Coder ≠ Developer**.
* Coding = typing syntax.
* Programming = designing **solutions using OOP principles**:

  * Classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism.
* Companies want **solution providers**, not just code typists.

> Mentor advice: “Think like a developer. Understand the concept. Implement thoughtfully. Then syntax becomes just your pen to draw the solution.” ✍️💡


### ✅ Key Takeaways from Today’s Session

1. Classes inherit from `Object` by default.
2. Concrete vs Abstract: Objects can/cannot be instantiated.
3. Overloading → same method, different parameters → compile-time (static) polymorphism.
4. Overriding → child changes parent behavior → runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.
5. Inheritance → reuse, “is-a” relationships.
6. Containment/Aggregation/Composition → “has-a” relationships.
7. Encapsulation & Abstraction → hide implementation, protect data.
8. Developer mindset → understand, design, then code.

> Mentor final note: “OOP is like crafting a story where each class is a character, each method is an action, and every relationship forms a plot. Master the story, and the syntax will just be your pen on paper.” 📖✒️

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                  Assessment (Concrete Class)     |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Members / Variables:**                    |
| - private int id                (instance)       |
| - private String testName       (instance)       |
| - private String subject        (instance)       |
| - private LocalDate creationDate (instance)      |
| - private LocalDate scheduleDate (instance)      |
| - public static int count       (class/shared)   |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Constructors:**                                |
| - public Assessment()                            |
|   (Default constructor)                          |
| - public Assessment(int id, String testName, ... |
|   (Parameterized constructor)                    |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Getter / Setter Methods (Encapsulation):**     |
| - public int getId()                             |
| - public void setId(int id)                      |
| - public String getTestName()                    |
| - public void setTestName(String testName)       |
| ... (similar for other data members)             |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Other Member Methods:**                        |
| - @Override public String toString()             |
| - Any other overridden methods (from Object)     |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Notes / Features:**                            |
| - Implements encapsulation via private members   |
|    + getters/setters                             |
| - Demonstrates method overloading (constructors) |
| - Demonstrates method overriding (toString)      |
| - Inherits from Object class implicitly          |
| - Uses 'this' keyword to                         |
|     distinguish instance vs local variables      |
| - count variable is static →                     |
     shared across all Assessment objects          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### **Relationships Diagram**

```
         Object (Root Class)
                ↑
         -----------------
         | Assessment    |  (Concrete class)
         -----------------
         | - id          |
         | - testName    |
         | - subject     |
         | - creationDate|
         | - scheduleDate|
         | - count (static)
         -----------------
         | +getId()      |
         | +setId()      |
         | +getTestName()|
         | +setTestName()|
         | +toString()   |
         -----------------
```

### **Polymorphism Examples**

1. **Static / Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**

   ```java
   public Assessment() { ... }            // Default
   public Assessment(int id, String testName, ...) { ... }  // Parameterized
   ```

2. **Dynamic / Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() { ... }       // Overrides Object's toString
   ```

### **Memory & Reference Notes**

* `id` → value type → stored on stack
* `testName` → reference type → object on heap, reference on stack
* `count` → static/class variable → single copy shared across all objects
* `this` → self-reference to instance object


### **Relationship Key**

* **is-a** → Inheritance (Assessment “is-a” Object)
* **has-a** → Containment/Composition (if Assessment had other classes as data members)
* **Encapsulation** → private variables + getters/setters
* **Abstraction** → hiding implementation, exposing only essential behavior

💡 **Mentor Insight:**

Think of this diagram as your **OOP blueprint** — a map of your class’s soul:

* **Variables** → who you are (data members)
* **Constructors** → how you’re born (default/parameterized)
* **Methods** → what you can do (getter/setter + other logic)
* **Polymorphism** → multiple ways to act
* **Relationships** → your family and friends (inheritance & composition)

If you **master this visual blueprint**, reading or designing any class will feel like reading a story instead of debugging a puzzle.

### **Legend / Notes**

* **“-” private**: data members not visible outside class → use getter/setter
* **“+” public**: methods accessible from outside
* **Static/class variable** (`count`) → shared across all objects
* **Constructors**: same name as class, may be overloaded
* **Overriding** → `toString()` overrides Object class method → runtime polymorphism
* **Overloading** → constructors with different parameters → compile-time polymorphism



### **Polymorphism Visual**

```
Static / Compile-Time (Overloading)
-----------------------------------
Assessment()
Assessment(id, testName, subject, ...)

Dynamic / Runtime (Overriding)
-----------------------------------
Object.toString()  --> overridden by  Assessment.toString()
```


### **Memory & Reference Notes**

* **id** → value type → stored on stack
* **testName, subject** → reference type → object on heap, reference on stack
* **count** → static → one shared memory in class area
* **this** → self-reference → refers to the current object instance



💡 **Mentor Tip:**
Imagine `Assessment` as a **person**:

* **Data members** → their attributes
* **Constructors** → their birth story / initialization
* **Methods** → skills or actions they can perform
* **Overloaded methods** → same skill in multiple ways
* **Overridden methods** → adapting inherited skills differently

### **Legend / Notes**

* **Aggregation (weak “has-a”)** → `Instructor`

  * `Assessment` **can exist without Instructor**, but may reference one
* **Composition (strong “has-a”)** → `GradingScheme`

  * `Assessment` **owns GradingScheme**, lifecycle tied to `Assessment`
* **Private data members** → accessed via getters/setters
* **Static variables** → shared memory (`count`)
* **Overriding & Overloading** → dynamic and static polymorphism
* **Inheritance** → from Object class implicitly

### **Mentor Storytelling Analogy**

Think of `Assessment` like **a school exam**:

* Its **attributes** (`id`, `subject`) are basic properties
* It **has an instructor** → aggregation (exam exists even if instructor changes)
* It **owns a grading scheme** → composition (cannot grade without it)
* **Methods** → what exam can do: get details, calculate results
* **Overloaded constructors** → same exam created in different ways (parameterized vs default)
* **Overridden methods** → inherited Object skills like `toString()` but customized
