# Web Server and 
In the context of Java web development, a "web server" and a "servlet container" are two closely related but distinct concepts.

1. **Web Server**:
   - A web server is software that serves HTTP requests from clients, typically web browsers, over the internet or an intranet. It listens for incoming requests on a specific port (usually port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS) and responds with the appropriate content.
   - In the Java ecosystem, a web server can refer to standalone servers like Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, or Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), which are used to serve static content and can also be configured to proxy requests to a servlet container.
   - However, in the context of Java web development, "web server" often refers to a servlet container, which is a specialized type of web server designed specifically for executing Java servlets and JSP pages.

2. **Servlet Container**:
   - A servlet container, also known as a servlet engine or web container, is a component of a web server that implements the Java Servlet specification. It provides the runtime environment for executing Java servlets and JSP pages.
   - Servlet containers manage the lifecycle of servlets, handle HTTP requests and responses, and provide other services required for Java web applications, such as session management, URL mapping, and security.
   - Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and JBoss/Wildfly are examples of servlet containers commonly used in Java web development. These containers are specifically designed to host and execute Java web applications.

In summary, while the term "web server" can refer to standalone servers that serve HTTP requests, in the context of Java web development, it often refers to a servlet container, which is a specialized server designed for executing Java servlets and JSP pages. Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat provide the runtime environment necessary for running Java web applications and are an essential component of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
