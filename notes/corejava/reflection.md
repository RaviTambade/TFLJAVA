## Reflection**
*Topic: Java Reflection + getClass()*


> *“In the hands of a skilled potter, pressure is not a burden, it’s a tool to shape brilliance.”*
> Similarly, in the hands of a skilled developer, Java Reflection isn't a mystery — it’s a superpower.


 **Scene 1: The Hidden Identity**
Once upon a time in the land of JavaLand, there was a brilliant young developer named Rohan. One evening, he stumbled upon an old piece of code—an object passed to him with no documentation, no type, and no clue about its structure. It was like receiving a **sealed diary** without a name on the cover.

Frustrated but curious, Rohan whispered,

> *“If only I knew who you are...”*

And then his mentor, old Mr. Javajee, chuckled and said,

> *“Use the mirror, Rohan — the **reflection**. Start with `getClass()`.”*


 **Scene 2: The First Glimpse – Using `getClass()`**

Rohan typed:

```java
Object mysteryObj = getObject(); // some object returned from elsewhere
Class<?> clazz = mysteryObj.getClass();
System.out.println("The class is: " + clazz.getName());
```

And voilà! The console replied:
 `The class is: com.transflower.models.Product`

> Rohan gasped, "So you're a Product! Now we’re getting somewhere..."

Just like meeting a stranger and asking for their visiting card — `getClass()` tells you **who the object really is**, even if it’s hidden behind an interface or a generic `Object` reference.


 **Scene 3: Peeking into the Diary – Reflection in Action**

Mr. Javajee encouraged him to go further:

> *“Now that you know the class, ask it about its secrets — fields, methods, constructors. Reflection will open the gates.”*

```java
for (Method method : clazz.getDeclaredMethods()) {
    System.out.println("Method: " + method.getName());
}
```

Rohan discovered all the abilities of the Product class — even the **private methods**!

He then explored fields:

```java
for (Field field : clazz.getDeclaredFields()) {
    field.setAccessible(true);
    System.out.println("Field: " + field.getName() + " = " + field.get(mysteryObj));
}
```

He could **read values from private fields**. “Whoa! I’m inside the diary now,” Rohan said.

 **Scene 4: The Responsibility**

But as Uncle Javajee said wisely:

> *“With great power comes great responsibility. Reflection is powerful — but don't misuse it.”*

* It can **break encapsulation**
* It’s **slower than direct access**
* And should be used **only when necessary** — like frameworks do (Spring, Hibernate, etc.)


 **Scene 5: Real-World Lesson**

Rohan later built a framework that could automatically:

* Read annotations
* Auto-wire dependencies
* Map JSON to objects

All thanks to **`getClass()`** — the first door he opened.


 **Mentor’s Final Words**

> "Reflection is like a backstage pass in Java.
> But always remember — just because you *can* sneak into the backstage, doesn’t mean you *should*… unless you’re the one running the show."


 **Key Takeaways:**

| Concept        | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getClass()`   | Returns the actual class of the object at runtime, even if declared as `Object` or interface |
| `Class<?>`     | A meta-object representing the runtime class; foundation of Reflection                       |
| Reflection API | Can inspect fields, methods, constructors, annotations, etc., at runtime                     |
| Use cases      | Serialization, Dependency Injection, Testing, ORMs, etc.                                     |
