# Your Personalized Java Learning Plan (6 Weeks)

Dear Students,

Learning Java is like unlocking the blueprint of digital architecture — from powering Android apps to enterprise-level systems. Let me walk you through a journey that I’ve designed for you — as if we were sitting together over a cup of chai, charting your path step-by-step.

Let’s begin this 6-week plan to go from **“Hello World” to Object-Oriented Mastery, Collections, JDBC, and REST APIs**.


## 🗓️ Week 1: Getting Started with Java

### 🎯 Goal: Set up your Java environment and understand the core basics of the language.

**Day 1-3: Setup & Java Fundamentals**

* 🧰 Tools: Install JDK + VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
* 🧪 Try: Run your first “Hello World” program.
* 🎓 Learn:

  * Variables, data types, input/output
  * Conditionals (`if`, `switch`)
  * Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

**Day 4-6: Core Programming Structures**

* 🧠 Practice:

  * Arrays, methods, and simple programs (like calculator, even/odd checker)
  * Introduction to Classes and Objects

**Day 7: Review Day**

* ✅ Build: Mini project — "Student Grade Calculator"


## 🗓️ Week 2: Deep Dive into Object-Oriented Programming

### 🎯 Goal: Master Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation.

**Day 8-10: OOP Foundations**

* 📘 Topics:

  * Classes, Objects, Constructors
  * `this` keyword, method overloading
* 🔍 Code Along: Library Book Management System

**Day 11-13: Advanced OOP**

* 🧠 Learn:

  * Inheritance, super keyword
  * Polymorphism (method overriding)
  * Access modifiers, encapsulation

**Day 14: Review & Mini Project**

* 🛠️ Project: "Bank Account Manager" using OOP concepts

## 🗓️ Week 3: Exception Handling, File I/O, and Packages

### 🎯 Goal: Understand how to organize Java code and handle real-world problems.

**Day 15-17: Exception Handling**

* 🔍 Focus:

  * `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`
  * Custom exceptions

**Day 18-19: File Handling**

* 📂 Read/Write to text files using `FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`, etc.

**Day 20-21: Java Packages and Access**

* 📦 Learn to create your own packages and import external packages

**Project**: Build a “Logbook App” that writes entries to a file with exception handling.

## 🗓️ Week 4: Collections Framework

### 🎯 Goal: Learn how to store and manipulate large groups of objects.

**Day 22-24: List and Set**

* 🧠 Learn:

  * `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`
  * `forEach`, lambda expressions

**Day 25-26: Map Interfaces**

* 🗺️ Explore:

  * `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `Hashtable`
  * Practical use cases (student marks, product price map)

**Day 27-28: Collections Practice**

* 🔁 Sort, filter, group using Java Streams (optional)
* 🧪 Project: “Inventory Manager” using Collections


## 🗓️ Week 5: JDBC & Database Connectivity

### 🎯 Goal: Connect Java to databases and perform CRUD operations.

**Day 29-31: JDBC Basics**

* 🔌 Connect to MySQL or SQLite
* Write programs to:

  * Insert, read, update, delete records

**Day 32-34: Layered Architecture**

* 🔄 Separate UI, Service, DAO layers
* Add error handling and user input validation

**Project**: Build a “Student Record Management System” with JDBC


## 🗓️ Week 6: Java Web Development + REST API Intro

### 🎯 Goal: Learn the basics of Java-based web development.

**Day 35-37: Introduction to Web Apps with Java**

* 🌐 Basics of Servlets and JSP
* Setup Tomcat server
* Build a simple “User Login” servlet app

**Day 38-40: REST APIs with Spring Boot**

* ☕ If ready, install Spring Boot CLI
* Create your first `@RestController`
* Build a basic JSON-based REST API (GET, POST)

**Day 41-42: Deployment & Testing**

* 📦 Package JAR file
* 🧪 Run tests, simulate real-world input/output

**Final Project (Day 43-44)**:

* 💼 Build a mini “Employee Management Portal” with:

  * OOP + Collections
  * JDBC
  * Web/REST interface (if you explore Spring)

## 📚 Continuous Learning Path:

* Learn JavaFX or Swing for GUI apps
* Dive into multithreading
* Explore Spring Boot deeper
* Build real-world projects or contribute to open source

### 🧭 Mentor's Tip:

*"Never rush. Java is a forest — explore tree by tree, code by code. Build real-world apps. Break your code. Fix it. That's how you grow."*
