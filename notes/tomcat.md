# What is Apache Tomcat ?

Think of a web server as a restaurant where you go to order food. The web server is like the kitchen in the restaurant. When you order food (visit a website), the kitchen (web server) prepares it and serves it to you.

Now, imagine Tomcat as a special chef in that kitchen who's really good at preparing certain types of dishes (handling certain types of web applications). So, while the main kitchen (web server) is busy cooking regular meals (serving regular web pages), if you order a special dish (visit a web application that requires specific handling), Tomcat steps in to cook it just right.


## WebServer?

 - A web server is software that serves HTTP requests from clients, typically web browsers, over the internet or an intranet. It listens for incoming requests on a specific port (usually port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS) and responds with the appropriate content.
   - In the Java ecosystem, a web server can refer to standalone servers like Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, or Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), which are used to serve static content and can also be configured to proxy requests to a servlet container.
   - However, in the context of Java web development, "web server" often refers to a servlet container, which is a specialized type of web server designed specifically for executing Java servlets and JSP pages.

Apache Tomcat, often referred to simply as Tomcat, is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It implements the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Expression Language (EL), and WebSocket technologies, providing a runtime environment for executing Java web applications.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat primarily functions as a servlet container, providing an environment for running Java servlets and JSP pages. Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and generate responses dynamically, while JSP pages allow developers to embed Java code within HTML pages.

2. **Open Source**: Tomcat is open-source software released under the Apache License version 2.0. This means it's free to use, modify, and distribute, making it a popular choice for Java web development.

3. **Cross-Platform**: Tomcat is written in Java and is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. This makes it suitable for deploying Java web applications in different environments.

4. **Lightweight and Embeddable**: Tomcat is lightweight and can be embedded within other applications, allowing developers to package their web applications with Tomcat and distribute them as standalone units.

5. **Configurable**: Tomcat provides extensive configuration options through XML-based configuration files such as `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and `context.xml`. These files allow you to customize various aspects of the server, including ports, connectors, virtual hosts, and deployment settings.

6. **Scalable**: Tomcat supports clustering and load balancing, allowing you to scale your web applications horizontally across multiple servers to handle increased traffic and improve performance and reliability.

7. **Security**: Tomcat provides built-in security features such as authentication, authorization, and SSL/TLS support to secure web applications and protect sensitive data.

8. **Management and Monitoring**: Tomcat includes management tools and monitoring capabilities, such as the Tomcat Manager web application and JMX (Java Management Extensions) support, which allow administrators to monitor server status, deploy and undeploy applications, and perform other administrative tasks.

Overall, Apache Tomcat is a popular choice for deploying Java web applications due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robustness. It provides a reliable runtime environment for running servlets and JSP pages, making it suitable for a wide range of web development projects.
