## The Journey from System to Web Application (and Why Tomcat Roars!)”

### 🎬 *Scene 1: The Curious Lab Session Begins...*

**Mentor Ravi**:
"Alright TAP team, let’s begin today’s journey with a simple question. When you switch on your computer, what exactly wakes up first?"

**Mentee Pankaj**:
"Uhh… BIOS?"

**Mentor**:
"Yes! The BIOS wakes up the system. But soon after, the real hero takes over — the **Operating System**, our mighty **System Software**. It's like the **conductor** in a grand orchestra — coordinating everything from your keyboard to your monitor."

🖥️ **System Software** = Operating System (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android)
🔌 **Device Drivers** = Tiny helpers that talk to your hardware: keyboard, mouse, RAM, disk


### 🧱 *Scene 2: The Software Tower*

**Mentor**:
"Imagine software as a multi-story building."

1. At the bottom: **Hardware** (RAM, CPU, Disk, etc.)
2. Next floor: **Device Drivers** (translate commands)
3. Above that: **Operating System (OS)** (Windows/Linux)
4. Finally, at the top: **Application Software**

🔼 Everything you build — Notepad, Paint, your own Java app — lives at the **top**. These are **Application Softwares**.


### 🧩 *Scene 3: Application Software Types*

**Mentor**:
"Let me ask you this — how many types of application software can you name?"

**Mentee Rani**:
"Console apps, Windows apps, Web apps…"

**Mentor**:
"Excellent! And now add: Mobile apps, Web services, REST APIs. They all sit on top of the OS. But wait — there's more magic underneath."


### 🔥 *Scene 4: Enter Java – The Knight in Shining Bytecode*

**Mentor**:
"When Java came into the world, it brought a full **ecosystem** — the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, **compiler**, **JVM**, and **packages** like `java.util`, `java.io`. It gave us the power to write **cross-platform apps**. Write once, run anywhere!"

👨‍💻 **Developer** → writes `.java` → Compiled to `.class` → JVM runs it using **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.

And when you want to **package your app**, you use:

* `.jar` = Java ARchive for simple apps
* `.war` = Web ARchive for web apps


### 🏗️ *Scene 5: Project Structure with Maven*

**Mentor**:
"Let’s bring in **Maven**. Think of Maven as your personal butler — it sets up your room, fetches your tools, and organizes your files."

```
my-java-project/
├── src/main/java/
├── src/main/resources/
├── target/
└── pom.xml
```

* `src/main/java`: Your source code
* `pom.xml`: Your project brain — dependencies, plugins
* `target/`: Where the `.jar` or `.war` is built


### 🧭 *Scene 6: Deploying the Java Web App – Where’s the Server?*

**Mentor**:
"Now, when you create a `.war` file, you can't just double-click it. You need a **Web Server**. Enter our star — **Tomcat**."

👑 **Tomcat** is a Java Web Server and Servlet container. It's where your `.war` file finds a home.


### 🐱 *Scene 7: Why the Name Tomcat?*

**Mentee Meena**:
"Sir, why is it called *Tomcat* though?"

**Mentor (smiling)**:
"Ahh, now we get to the legend. Tomcat was created by **James Duncan Davidson** at Sun Microsystems. He wanted something symbolic — **agile, confident, independent** — just like a Tomcat (the animal). A server that could take care of itself."

Apache Software Foundation adopted it — catchy name, easy to remember, and not overly technical. Just like naming your best pet — but one that runs Java web apps!"

🐾 **Tomcat = Agile, Independent, Standalone Server**
📜 Inspired by **animal metaphor** for self-sufficiency


### 🛡️ *Scene 8: Behind the Curtains – Servlet + JSP*

**Mentor**:
"In the world of Java Web, every request goes through a **Servlet** — your hotel receptionist. It checks the request and forwards it to a **JSP** — like your room service — who processes and returns the response."

🧾 Request → **Servlet** → **JSP** → Response to Client
Your `.war` holds all of this: Servlets, JSPs, classes, configs


### 🌐 *Scene 9: Desktop vs Web vs Distributed*

**Mentor**:
"Let’s compare."

| Type                | Example | Characteristics                                         |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop App**     | MS Word | Runs on one PC                                          |
| **Web App**         | Gmail   | Runs on a web server, accessed via browser              |
| **Distributed App** | Amazon  | Spans multiple servers, components on different systems |

🛒 E-commerce example: Product Catalog, Cart, Orders — all may run on different servers, but form **one big app**.


### 🌍 *Scene 10: Closing Thoughts – From BIOS to Tomcat*

**Mentor**:
"So from the moment you switch on your machine, there's a chain of heroes at work — BIOS → OS → Device Drivers → JVM → Your Java App → Tomcat Web Server — finally serving responses to your users."

"And why Tomcat? Because just like a real Tomcat — it’s strong, agile, and doesn’t need handholding. Your `.war` finds a reliable, purring home in it."


### 💡 *Epilogue: Mentor’s Takeaway*

**Mentor**:
"Remember, every great app needs a solid foundation — understand your **system software**, respect the **runtime**, and deploy with the confidence of a Tomcat."

"Java isn’t just about syntax. It’s about building systems that live, breathe, and roar!"
