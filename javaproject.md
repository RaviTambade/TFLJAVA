# Java Project Structure

A typical Java project structure follows a convention that helps in organizing your code and resources efficiently. Here's a common Java project structure:

```
project-name/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/
│   │   │       └── tfl/
│   │   │           └── YourClass.java
│   │   │
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       └── config.properties
│   │
│   └── test/
│       ├── java/
│       │   └── com/
│       │       └── tfl/
│       │           └── YourClassTest.java
│       │
│       └── resources/
│           └── test-config.properties
│
├── target/
│   ├── classes/
│   ├── test-classes/
│   └── (other generated files)
│
├── pom.xml
└── (other project files)
```

Let's break it down:

1. **src/main/java**: This directory contains your main Java source code files. Typically, you'd organize your packages here. For example, if your package is `com.example`, your Java files would be under `src/main/java/com/example/`.

2. **src/main/resources**: Resources used by your main application code, such as configuration files, XML files, property files, etc., are placed here.

3. **src/test/java**: Unit test classes go here. This directory mirrors the structure of the main source directory. Test classes usually have the same package structure as the classes they are testing.

4. **src/test/resources**: Resources for tests, such as test configuration files or sample input files, are placed here.

5. **target**: This directory is where Maven places the compiled classes, test classes, and any other generated files during the build process. It's generated and managed by Maven and typically not checked into version control.

6. **pom.xml**: The Project Object Model (POM) file defines the project configuration and dependencies. It's an XML file that contains information about the project and various configuration options.

This structure provides a clean and organized way to manage your Java project's source code, resources, tests, and build artifacts. It's worth noting that this is a common convention, but you can customize it to fit your project's specific needs.
